                <p>"Finding a web designer is challenging for any small business. I was fortunate to have Sarah recreate a website for our business. Her communication was superb and it was obvious that she was interested in developing a long-term relationship with Blue Wire. Sarah paid attention to every detail of our design, layout, and welcomed our input and heard all of my concerns or recommendations. I will continue to use Code Greer to manage our site updates, and to create new features. I highly recommend Code Greer's web design for your business!"

                <p>"I’m so pleased with the website Sarah built for my business. We didn’t have a designer and weren’t really settled on a particular design when we started. But Sarah was able to take many of my thoughts and ideas, make suggestions, and put them all together into a great design that works perfectly. It looks great on computers as well as tablets and phones. And she was really great to work with - very patient when we asked for changes, and always keeping us updated on progress. Every day when I look at our website I’m grateful I chose Code Greer, and would recommend Sarah to anyone who needs a website built."

Beginning with our initial meeting, she asked insightful questions, offered intelligent feedback, and anticipated aspects of the project before I did. Her email responses were prompt, courteous, and thorough. Sarah took the time to understand my business, and captured its essence and purpose beautifully. My site looks fantastic across phones, tablets, and computers - all devices and browsers I've tried. Sarah's enthusiasm for the project never waned; she was as energetic and committed at the end as she had been in our initial meeting."

She's a pro at finding the RIGHT solutions for clients' specific needs, and she's not afraid to dig for the answer or put in long hours to reach deadlines. She's the most reliable freelancer I've ever collaborated with, she's awesome at code, and she's also just a pleasure to work with. When the project was finished, I was sad that I wouldn't get to work with Sarah on a daily basis!"

            <h2>The crafting of a website</h2>
            <p class="about">Have you noticed websites look fairly similar these days? Pretty boring, right? Your business is unique. Your site should be too. It should distinguish you from your competitors. That's the essence of what I do.</p>
            
            <p class="about">I build handcrafted websites tailored to your specific needs. I give them a personal touch. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It's not a template.</p>
            
            <p class="about">When built from scratch, a website develops it's own unique style. Colors, fonts, textures, and word structure set the tone. Design should say as much about your business as your content does.</p>
            
            <p class="about">Responsive design, how your site displays on all screens, from TVs to mobile phones, is an extension of that style. This is a priority. It's not enough to design around current technology. My goal is to ensure your website looks amazing now, and in the future.</p>
            
            <p class="about">The final touches are in accessibility and search engine optimization. I add captions for visual disabilities, check colors for proper contrast, choose font sizes for readability, and add code for better indexing in search engines and on social media.</p>
